# Monthly Sales Report Automation with VBA

## Project Description

This VBA project is designed to automate various tasks associated with monthly sales reports in Excel. The project includes several subroutines that work together to streamline the process of creating pivot tables, generating charts, copying Excel content to PowerPoint for presentations, and cleaning up the workbook by deleting pivot tables and charts. This automation is particularly useful for businesses or individuals regularly dealing with sales data and requiring consistent report formats.

  - Generates new pivot tables with specific fields for Branch, Date, Category, and Revenue.
  - Formats data fields.

### 2. `CreateChart` Subroutine
- **Functionality**: Generates column clustered charts for each worksheet (excluding "MacroButtons").
- **Key Operations**: 
  - Deletes any existing charts.

2. Press `Alt + F11` to open the VBA editor.
3. Insert a new module (Insert > Module).
4. Copy and paste the provided VBA code into the module.
5. Close the VBA editor and return to your Excel workbook.

## Usage

Run the desired subroutine based on your needs:
- Use `CreatePivot` to generate pivot tables for data analysis.
- Use `CreateChart` to visualize data with charts.
- Use `Copy_Excel_To_PPT` to prepare PowerPoint presentations with your data.
- Use `DeletePivotTablesAndCharts` to clean up the workbook before starting a new report cycle.

## A dedicated sheet named "MacroButtons" contains buttons for each subroutine:

- Create Pivot Tables: Runs CreatePivot.
- Create Charts: Executes CreateChart.
- PowerPoint Presentation: Initiates Copy_Excel_To_PPT.
- Clear Charts & Pivots: Activates DeletePivotTablesAndCharts.
Click the respective button to run a subroutine.
